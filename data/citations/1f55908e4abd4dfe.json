Kantorowicz argued that medieval corporation theory built on Roman legal conceptual foundations but acquired a deeper conception of the immortality of legal constructions like corporations, and later states, from its medieval ideas about the eternal life of angels and the doctrine of corpus Christi, entities that maintain their identity in spite of change.
