The periods specified for the projects begin with the year of approval (or cost estimate) and end with the completion of the project. For each project we have specified the government that was the initiator of the project, or the major funding source. The cost figures for the Erie Canal include the cost of the Champlain Canal. The projected costs were prepared in March 1817 and were those in place when the legislature approved the plan in that year. For those estimates and the actual cost of constructing the two canals, see “Internal Improvements in the State of New York",
      "For the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal, see Gray",
      "the cost estimate we use here is the one prepared by the consulting engineers, which leads to a slightly lower ratio of expenditures to estimated costs. For the Ohio and Miami canals, see Bogart",
