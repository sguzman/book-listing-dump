      "Partial confirmation of Fletcher’s point is offered by Pieper’s observation that “In the German-speaking world, fairness does not seem to be a philosophical concept, much less an ethico-philosophical concept.” As quoted in Claudia Pawlenka. “The Idea of Fairness: A General Ethical Concept or One Particular to Sports Ethics"
