      "From 1933 (the first year of FDR’s presidency and thus the beginning of the New Deal) until 1981 (the first year of Reagan’s presidency), the Democrats controlled both houses of Congress every year except 1947–1949 and 1953–1955. It was a remarkable half-century of one-party dominance. Since 1981, however, when Republicans gained control of both the Senate and the presidency, no party has controlled both houses of Congress for more than eight years in a row (the Democrats from 1987 to 1995, but at a time when the Republicans held the White House except for the last two years). Thus 1981 truly marks the end of New Deal and Great Society epoch, as reflected in the Democratic hegemony in Congress during that time.
