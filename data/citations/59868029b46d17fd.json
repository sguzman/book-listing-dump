The author, with completeness unsurpassed since then, discovers and analyzes documents of the Siberian Department of early Russian government, the Müller copies of the local archives. It should be especially emphasised that the task of broad multifaceted study and publication of those sources, proposed by A. P. Okladnikov in 1937, remain crucial yet today. The author consequently sets an informational value of the source, in accordance with the real life position of its author, and with the degree he understood the local conditions (especially interesting in this plan is his study of formal replies",

Correctly noted was the connection of the volume of this chronicling in the second half of the eighteenth – beginning of the nineteenth centuries with the efflorescence of Irkutsk trade and with strengthening of the Irkutsk merchant class",
