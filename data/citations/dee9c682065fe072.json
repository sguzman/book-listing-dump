(As of this writing, the latest figures from the U.S. Bureau of the Census use much more sophisticated methods to project that the U.S. population in 2040 will be 380 million.) However, there is considerable danger in making estimates for times that are beyond the scope of the available data. For example, the quadratic model suggests that in 1492, the U.S. population was 671 million, which is a result statisticians refer to as ridiculous. The quadratic model appears to be good for the available data"
