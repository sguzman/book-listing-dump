Paddison argues that two religio-­racial visions competed with each other—­one emphasizing “Christian white male supremacy” and the other “anti-­Catholicism and paternalistic racial uplift” (9). This chapter builds on Paddison’s work by further interrogating the meanings of the term “heathen” as applied to the Chinese."
