      "Gandhi, An Autobiography, 298–299; Dalton, Gandhi’s Power, ix–xi. Gandhi is typically seen as sui generis, an evaluation which he encouraged through his autobiography. However, at least in the 1880s, there were movements among Brahmins to reform Indian society by promoting the value of manual labor among the higher castes. This can be seen regularly in the newspaper Mahratta. See, for example, “Technical Education and the Higher Classes,” Mahratta, April 1, 1888."
