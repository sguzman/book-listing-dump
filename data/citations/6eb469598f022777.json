It examines a breadth of officials and intellectuals who devoted themselves to thinking about and planning the postwar world prior to Pearl Harbor. It foregrounds ideas of internationalism as an explanatory context and a source of legitimation. It also interprets the war­time embrace of global military supremacy as breaking more sharply from the Wilsonian past than does Thompson.
