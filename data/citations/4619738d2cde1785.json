Similarly, the dose of 1 to 5 mcg seems infinitesimal even for children—25 mcg was considered the threshold dose for adults, and standard doses were frequently given to children. Therefore, 1–5 mcg/kg may have been the correct dose range. However, these doses are listed in several versions of the FDA report and could merely represent the dose range considered nontoxic"
