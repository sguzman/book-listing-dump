      "753–792, who show that a $1 increase in government spending in one U.S. state relative to a neighbor is associated with a $1.50 increase in that state’s output. They observe that this estimate is higher than the average estimate of fiscal multipliers and attribute the difference to the fact that, when government spending goes up in one state relative to another, monetary policy does not change. Similarly, monetary policy does not change in response to fiscal policy in a liquidity trap. However, another article suggested the multiplier to be 0.7 to 0.9 over two to four years, and the authors argue that empirical evidence does not show that multipliers are higher in recessions"

Moreover, this effect may not even succeed in bringing interest rates on long-term assets to zero.
