      "rejects the view that a misguided attempt at racial uplift, a “white man’s burden” of sorts, weighed in favor of expansion. Instead, Love observes that race was always an argument against annexation during the period. Elsewhere, as in the Jim Crow South, and at other times, as during the slave trade or after 1898, the United States opted for racial subjugation over disengagement. I argue that it was only racism as constrained by the Reconstruction Constitution that motivated the three-decade halt to annexations.

Sandefur explains, in “Access to Civil Justice,” 16.14, how money, information, social networks, faith in the legitimacy and efficacy of legal institutions, and the availability of a legal institution willing to hear one’s claim can each increase the likelihood that a person will make use of legalistic institutions."

A four-person plurality friendly to labor supported the director’s report, the radical recommendations of which included an end to judicial declarations that legislation was unconstitutional and an end to privately owned mines. Three members friendly to business presented separate justifications for employers’ hostility toward labor. The final two members took a middle road, dedicating substantial attention to the creation of state and federal industrial commissions. Only the director’s report addressed Puerto Rico directly.
