      "Superstition” was a mutable concept in early modern Europe. The term was frequently used pejoratively to dismiss the religious beliefs of one’s opponents. Protestant reformers applied the term to the beliefs and practices associated with the old religions, both Catholic and pagan. The term could also be applied to those expressing excessive religiosity or using “legitimate” religious practices for inappropriate purposes, such as magical healing; see especially, Andrew Cambers, “Demonic Possession, Literacy and ‘Superstition’ in Early Modern England"
