Furthermore the endless battles among country listeners about what constitutes “real country” involve constant negotiations of white rural identity",

      "Clearly George Wallace’s racial demagoguery and Richard Nixon’s “southern strategy” shaped the politics of the period, as many whites came to resent forced busing and affirmative action.

Key works on both sides of this debate include",
