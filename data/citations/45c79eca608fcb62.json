For instance, some batteries can have very negative health and environmental effects, depending on how they’re manufactured, handled, and disposed of. Materials used in lead-acid batteries are far more toxic than those used in lithium-ion and nickel metal hydride batteries. The average lead-acid starter battery in today’s vehicles contains 17.5 pounds of the potent neurotoxin lead and 1.5 gallons of corrosive sulfuric acid",
