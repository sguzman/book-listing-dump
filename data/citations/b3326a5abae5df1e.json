      "Beguine claims to be bringing together the roles of Mary and Martha could themselves be used as evidence against them by those critical of the movement. In his Dit des Beguines, the poet Rutebeuf satirizes double claims that he reads as hypocrisy: “If a beguine marries, that is her vocation, because her vows or profession are not for life. Last year she wept, now she prays, next year she’ll take a husband. Now she is Martha, then she is Mary; now she is chaste, then she gets a husband. But remember: say only good things of her, because the King would not tolerate otherwise"
