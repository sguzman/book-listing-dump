      "There is considerable interest in and debate over the character of the nineteenth-­ century United States: was it first and foremost an imperial nation-­state, an administrative state, a military-­fiscal state, a settler empire, or something else? What matters here is how the American state appeared to the Native Americans who clashed with it, went to war with it, allied with it, and were dispossessed by it. For many Native peoples, the American state appeared a remote force with an astounding ability to effect change from a distance through the deployment of soldiers and government agents.
