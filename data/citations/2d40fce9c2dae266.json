      "The Firm reviews the actuarial assumptions for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans on an annual basis. To reflect the decline in market interest rates during 2002, the year-end discount rate for the Firm’s U.S. plans was set at 6.50%, a 75-basis point decline from the prior year. Additionally, considering the current mix of plan assets, the year-end assumed long-term rate of return was adjusted downward to 8.00% for both U.S. pension plan assets and other postretirement benefit plan assets, from 9.25% and 9.00%, respectively. The assumed long-term rate of return is a blended average of the Firm’s investment advisor’s projected long-term (10 years or more) returns for various asset classes. The impact of these changes is expected to increase 2003 U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit expenses by approximately $60 million. Additionally, the adverse effect of losses on U.S. plan assets is expected to further increase U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit expenses by approximately $70 million"

The primary drivers were the acquisition of the Providian portfolio and overall higher revenue. These results were achieved in a highly competitive market environment and a weak U.S. economy. Industry challenges included competitive pricing, increased competition for new accounts, depressed response rates to credit card solicitations as costs to acquire new accounts increased, and declining acceptances to balance consolidation offers"
