      "I argued that the coins depicted in the open sacks in the illustration for July might represent contorniates, those bronze pseudomedallions identifiable by their raised outer edges. The coins in the July image all have uniform concentric furrows or grooves around the edges that would be otherwise problematic. No other depictions of coins occur in V., but the coins in the sparsio of the Emperor Constantius (Fig. 13) in R. lack this double edge, as do the coins in the fourth­century Notitia Dignitatum (Fig. 84). There are few fourth­century illustrations of coins to which we may turn for comparanda: the coins in the distribution of money depicted on the Arch of Constantine are one example, but these lack the uniform furrow illustrated in",
      "The closest comparanda for the coins in July are three sixth­century consular diptychs; see Volbach",
      "Do these sixth­century diptych representations preserve accurately the distribution of certain kinds of contorniates and medallions at the consular games, or is the addition of a groove a distinctive late­antique way of depicting coins? This second possibility makes the identification with the contorniates only hypothetical for now"

      "does faithfully reproduce the general iconography and the specific attributes for each month; only the birds are missing from the upper right corner of December in B",
      "The details in B., however, tend to be more concrete than in R. For example, the toes on the foot of the February figure are well defined in B. but only lightly outlined in R1; and the basket with figs in the representation of September is boldly drawn in B. but rather loosely defined in R1. Yet while these two manuscripts display a noticeable difference in style, in content and iconography they seem true to their exemplar. The illustrations of the months in B. are particularly useful to us, for they corroborate further the veracity of R. Only the dedicatory page (Fig. 44) in B. is problematic, for comparison of this copy with R1 reveals certain iconographic differences: a curtain is included in B., while the letter s from the monogram and a bullock from the neck of one putto are omitted. These same inconsistencies (plus an architectural backdrop) recur in Bucherius's well­known 1634 edition of the Codex­Calendar (Fig. 87),60 which would seem to indicate that Bucherius based his edition on B.61 The title (footnote continued from the previous page",
