      "That American credibility has hit an all-time low in the Arab world is borne out by a survey commissioned by University of Maryland Professor Shibley Telhami in five Arab countries with regimes that are not unfriendly to the U.S.— Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, and Lebanon—shortly before the beginning of the war against Iraq. The survey conducted between February 19 and March 11, 2003 found that of those surveyed only 4 percent in Saudi Arabia, 6 percent in Morocco and Jordan, 13 percent in Egypt, and 32 percent in Lebanon (which has a significant Christian minority) had a favorable opinion of the United States. An overwhelming percentage felt that U.S. policy toward Iraq is motivated mainly by oil and secondarily by U.S. support for Israel and very few believed that a war against Iraq would promote democracy in the Middle East. Furthermore, more than threequarters of the respondents in every country believed that a war against Iraq would prompt more terrorism toward the U.S",

In the face of American pundits who drew caricatures of U.N. negligence and appetite for appeasement that verged on black helicopter imagery, European politicians defended a U.N. whose role was so central and record so spotless that it was unrecognizable to anyone who had worked at the U.N. or studied its performance. While U.S. neo-conservatives described a role for American power that was both extraordinarily expansive and utterly benign, politicians, commentators, and populations from Europe, the Arab world, and elsewhere began to perceive U.S. actions as the greatest threat to world stability. This battle between straw men and blind men obscured more than it has revealed about the sources of U.S. foreign policy in Iraq and the Middle East, or the role of the U.N"

      "and at best a fluctuating engagement with allies and multilateral institutions. For the most part, U.S. policy in the period, actively supported by Israel, was to keep any third party actor other than the U.S. out of any negotiations. Of course, the first major political breakthrough of the era, the Oslo Accords, occurred under Norwegian sponsorship and with no U.S. involvement. So important was U.S. backing to those Accords, however, that the decision was taken by the Norwegian sponsors of the deal to ask the U.S. President to host the signing ceremony at the White House—a meeting that resulted in the now famous handshake between Israeli President Yitzhak Rabin and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat.8 Notwithstanding the Norwegian role in Oslo, in the formal negotiating sessions that occurred during the 1990s, from Sharm el-Sheikh to the Hebron Agreements to Wye River to Camp David in July 2000, participation was strictly trilateral: U.S., Israeli, Palestinian. A variety of countries, including Canada and Sweden, hosted informal talks between Israelis and Palestinians but were never brought into formal negotiations.

In the 1940s, 1960s, and again in the 1970s the U.N. Secretary-General appointed political mediators to the Arab–Israeli theatre, with Security Council backing. But in the wake of the U.S.–Israel–Egypt peace deal brokered by Jimmy Carter at Camp David, and Arab reaction to that peace (including blocking an agreed U.N. peacekeeping force to monitor the settlement), the U.N.’s role in peacemaking in the Middle East faltered.19 Only recently has the U.N"

There is no space in this chapter to examine U.S. policy in Afghanistan. But in terms of the broad argument, two points are important. First, the roles played by the U.N.—in authorizing U.S. action, in the person of Brahimi, and in mounting UNAMA—were actively supported by the U.S. as in its interests and were conducted in close coordination with U.S. policy-makers. Second, the fact that U.S. policy objectives received broad international support meant that this first exercise in the projection of U.S. power in the “war on terrorism” did not directly, or at first glance, challenge international order and the multilateral mechanisms designed to secure it"

On this issue, current U.S. policy is arguably operating on a fundamental misconception—namely the “public diplomacy” argument that opposition to the U.S. can be challenged by more information about U.S. policy. This approach seems to elide the fact that Arab newspapers and television stations (whether government-owned or privately operated) provide extensive coverage of U.S. policy statements and actions. Sometimes this is accompanied by critical commentary. But Arab newspapers routinely print the full statements of President Bush and Secretary of State Powell (along with those of European leaders and the U.N. Secretary-General) for their readers, and these statements are often broadcast in full on the main satellite channels. U.S. policy is so out of sync with general Arab attitudes that these statements need no critical commentary to provoke negative reactions in the general public. Furthermore, it is important to understand the distinction between Arab public opinion about the United States and Arab opinion about U.S"

What this suggests is that there will be a growing problem for the U.S. about how it projects its power and its policy. Here, multilateral institutions may over time play a useful role. The nature of political debate in the Middle East is such that even if Arab governments have little choice but to concede to most U.S. demands, the act of concession to those demands is one that diminishes the legitimacy of governments in the eyes of their populations, and generates resistance against both the demand in question and its source. Thus U.S. pressure for greater liberalization or democratic reform in any given Arab country may be resisted by precisely those groups seeking to move forward on a democratic agenda (as witnessed during June 2003 in the case of Iran).

It is again too early to say, but some speculation here may also be undertaken. On the central question of the impact on the United Nations, I would speculate that damage to the Security Council from U.S. actions and attitudes is probably significantly less than has been stated, for five reasons. First, the U.N. has been bypassed by the U.S. before, notably in Kosovo, without causing grievous damage.
