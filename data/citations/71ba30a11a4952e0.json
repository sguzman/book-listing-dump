Stephen Geller (letter of August 1, 1991) has suggested to me that this debate concerning the Deuteronomistic History is symptomatic of the general state of biblical studies in the early 1960s, when the consensus position that was developed and refined in Germany began to fall apart. The dissolution of this consensus opened the field to newer methodologies, such as the literary study of the Bible. For an essay which expresses the attitude toward the disintegration of the standard views, see John Bright, “Modern Study of the Old Testament Literature"
