      "Ian Copland describes Robert Phayre as “honest, averagely intelligent, zealous in the execution of his duties, and somewhat tactless when dealing with ‘inferiors.’ At the same time he possessed qualities of drive, audacity and initiative which set him apart from the mass of his professional colleagues.” This appears to be a far too sympathetic assessment of the man. Further exploration of archival materials in India and United Kingdom, and consideration of Naoroji’s own rec­ords, has led me to judge Phayre as a much more complex—­and occasionally devious—­character. “The Baroda Crisis of 1873–77: A Study in Governmental Rivalry"
