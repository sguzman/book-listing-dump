However, I wish to suggest something narrower: it was not the market per se, but the technologies that evolved alongside the market—­many of them quantitative—­that connected p­ eople to distant c­ auses. ­These tools have (and continue to have) many dif­fer­ent kinds of politics. They can be tools for amelioration and for profit seeking, for remembering and for forgetting.
