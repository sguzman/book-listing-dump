      "a bureau of standards had existed, but in a very specialized capacity, as a small branch of the coast and geodetic survey, which dealt exclusively with fixing standards of length, mass, and time. The new, enlarged bureau was initially set up as a part of the Treasury Department (the Treasury had previously housed the Office of Weights and Measurements, founded in 1832, which was superseded by the new bureau). It was moved to the Department of Commerce and Labor when that department was created in 1904 and stayed a part of the Commerce Department when the Department of Labor was created in 1913. The bureau had two branches, one that undertook scientific and technical research and conducted product testing, the other concerned with commercial standardization",
