H.R. 1732 takes the controversy out of the Federal courts where it belongs, H.R. 1732 deprives the patent owner of important rights and protections that the patent owner has in the Federal courts, H.R. 1732 protects the large company from the legal recourse of the patent owner, and H.R. 1732 places the small entity owner at the mercy of predatory large companies"
