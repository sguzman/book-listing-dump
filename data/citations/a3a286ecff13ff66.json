      "­These signs of slowdown ­were not always immediate noticed, owing to a surge of increased investments following a steep rise of oil prices and the end of fixed exchange rates, not to mention the vio­lence that broke out around 1968, notably in New York, Los Angeles, and Paris. It took the ­whole de­cade or more to sense the new developments, though they seem clearer by now. See Assar Lindbeck, “The Recent Slowdown of Productivity Growth",
      "Symposium on the Slowdown in Productivity Growth",
      "­Those economists ­were referring to ­labor productivity—­that is, output per worker or per hour worked",
      "poring over data he had constructed on the growth rate of total ­factor productivity in the American economy, noticed far slower growth rates from 1972 with some ups and downs. (At my suggestion, he calculated the growth rate in the periods 1922–1972 and 1972–2012, which showed far slower growth over the latter period. The latter growth rate was approximately half the ­earlier growth rate"

Ricardo presented a scenario in which the demand for ­labor falls as machinery substitutes for ­human ­labor. See Agnar Sandmo, Economics Evolving: A History of Economic Thought",
      "Following his analy­sis, Ricardo concluded “that the opinion entertained by the laboring class, that the employment of machinery is frequently detrimental to their interests, is not founded on prejudice and error, but is conformable to the correct princi­ples of po­liti­cal economy"
