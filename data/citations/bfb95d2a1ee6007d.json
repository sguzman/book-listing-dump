The Pareto distribution was first proposed by Vilfredo Pareto at the end of the nineteenth century, and takes the mathematical form that the proportion of the population with earnings of Y and above is proportional to Y -Â�a, where a is known as the Pareto coefÂ�fiÂ�cient. It is a property of the Pareto distribution that the mean income above Y is equal to a/(a-Â�1) Y.
