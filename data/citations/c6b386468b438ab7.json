He described the rest of his journey to Lassen’s ranch in letters to Sabrina and George the following spring. 132. These are the same people that we have met on various parts of the gold rush trail of 1849. It is not surprising that their names should show up since they were very much in demand by the goldrushers. A good narrative of Chiles’s 1843 trip is in Stewart, California Trail, 36–47. 133. Lassen is an interesting character in California history, hated by many goldrushers but still considered a major figure in the state with many places named after him, including a mountain, a national park, and a national forest. The most recent article concerning Lassen is Andy Hammond, “Peter Lassen and His Trail"
