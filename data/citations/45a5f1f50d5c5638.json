On this day, the short specifies which particular issue will be delivered. The short has until 2:00 P.M. central standard time to make this declaration. (On the last possible notice day in the delivery month, the short has until 3:00 P.M.) The CBOT then selects the long to whom delivery will be made. This is the long position that has been outstanding for the longest period of time. The long is then notified by 4:00 P.M. that delivery will be made. The third day is the delivery day"
