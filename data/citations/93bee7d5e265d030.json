      "Against Germany, with the exception of its participation in the notorious 1945 incendiary attack on Dresden, the U.S. restricted itself to daylight “precision” bombing raids using high explosives, its stated objective being to avoid unnecessary civilian deaths. Against Japan—about which U.S. officials openly announced their desire to precipitate “extermination of the Japanese people in toto”—the preferred method was nocturnal saturation bombing by masses of aircraft dropping incendiaries to create “firestorms” in which vast numbers of noncombatants were deliberately cremated. During the great Tokyo fire raid of March 9–10, 1945, to give but one example, more than 267,000 buildings were destroyed, a million people rendered homeless, and upwards of 100,000 burned alive. Under such conditions, more “innocent civilians”—to use the currently popular American catch-phrase—were killed in only six months than among all branches of the Japanese military during the entirety of World War II"
