The argument presented here is parallel to the argument advanced by Vannevar Bush on why the National Science Foundation in postwar America should be a quasiautonomous body, controlled by a National Science Board made up of scientists. Only the director and the staff of the foundation became government employees, responsible to the president, not a regular department. Scientists receiving grants were thus not government employees, not subject to bureaucratic control, and free to work on subjects agreed to by their peer scientists.
