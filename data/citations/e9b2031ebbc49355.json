      "Latina/o immigrants are routinely blamed for Black unemployment and poverty. With some notable exceptions, however, such as the janitorial industry, evidence suggests that Latina/o immigration has had a mixed impact. For instance, Ong and Valenzuela found that while Latina/o immigration affected Black joblessness (but not earnings), equally important was the role of institutional racism and employer discrimination. Paul Ong and Abel Valenzuela, “The Labor Market: Immigrant Effects and Racial Disparities,” in Waldinger and Bozorgmehr, Ethnic Los Angeles, 165–91. Likewise, Waldinger and Lichter argue that immigration has contributed to “African Americans being ‘pulled’ rather than ‘pushed’ out of their employment concentrations",
