He argues that Claudius first expelled Jews from Rome (so Suetonius and Orosius) and – after many returned –attempted to prohibit their meeting in public",
      "Bruce imagines the precisely opposite scenario: meetings were first banned, and expulsion followed (New Testament History",
      "But the fact of a disturbance involving Jews is well established; that it had an immediate impact upon Christianity is a sound inference (cf. Acts 18:2; Cassius Dio, Roman History 60.66; Suetonius, Claudius 25.4; Orosius, Seven Books of History against the Pagans 7.6). In any case, Wiefel is clearly correct in viewing Romans as an appeal for unity to a mixed church"
