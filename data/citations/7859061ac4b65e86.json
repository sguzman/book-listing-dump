      "I show that Eisgruber and Sager take it for granted that religious interests should be protected, before they look for a relevant comparator in existing law. This approach, however, remains too wedded to U.S. doctrine: the reasoning is ad hoc and does not reflect on the justness of existing arrangements, i.e., the baseline prob­lem. So it does not get to the heart of the normative questions I raise h ­ ere. For other commentary on the theory of equal liberty, see Berg, “Can Religious Liberty Be Protected”",
