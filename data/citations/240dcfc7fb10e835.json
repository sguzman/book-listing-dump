Nearly all of Fairchild’s early products went to government—primarily military—uses. The Defense Department invested over $1 billion in semiconductor R&D between 1958 and 1974, and as late as 1965, the Pentagon purchased 70 percent of the nation’s integrated circuit output. Even after the rapid growth of the consumer electronics market in the 1970s reduced semiconductor companies’ dependence on government customers—by 1978, the Pentagon’s integrated circuit purchases accounted for only 7 percent of sales—the military maintained a strong presence in Silicon Valley"
