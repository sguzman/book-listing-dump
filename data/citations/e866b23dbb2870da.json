      "argued that, all in all, the creation and execution of the New Deal model has been of fundamental importance in achieving labor's liberation. Early developments and debates in the field have been discussed in a number of historiographic and survey essays. Melvyn Dubofsky, \"Legal Theory and Workers' Rights",
      "496—502, was one of the earliest, offering a \"historian's critique\" of what had been to that point almost entirely a revisionist legal scholarship. During the following decade Dubofsky built his critique into a comprehensive account of the century from 1870-1970, published as The State and Labor in Modern America",
      "Another historian's appraisal several years after Dubofsky's showed how the contribution of historians had gown in the interim and also how the debate had moved beyond revisionist legal scholarship's focus on the New Deal's collective bargaining model",
