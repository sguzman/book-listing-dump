      "Jews: A Dual Identity",
      "As Jack Jacobs has observed, Adorno’s father did not wish for his son to have a bar mitzvah, and Teddie Wiesengrund was confirmed as a Lutheran. Jacobs argues that neither Adorno’s sense of impending disaster for the Jews nor his analysis of anti-Semitism “can be attributed to Jewish identity” in the sense of growing up in an observant household",
      "The Frankfurt School, Jewish Lives, and Antisemitism",
      "Concurring with Jacobs’s conjecture that Adorno’s “half-Jewishness” attuned him to the peril of Jews living in Hitler’s Europe in the 1930s, I would add that if understood in terms of negative identity, Adorno had a not not-Jewish identity by 1937 when he left for America. It is also tragically true that in Central Europe during the 1930s and 1940s, expulsions and violence objectively defined the relation between Jewish identity and negative identity. 23. Leo Lowenthal, An Unmastered Past: The Autobiographical Reflections of Leo Lowenthal",
      "24. In line with the Marxian and Kantian traditions, Adorno resisted dignifying anticapitalist, antimodernist, or anti-Semitic discourses of race with a “concept” thereof. Considering race a suspect classification in legal, philosophical, or ethical thinking, Adorno helped create the research topic of “racism",
