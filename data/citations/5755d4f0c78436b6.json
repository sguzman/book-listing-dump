      "insulating washers with thermal resistance of 1*4°C/W. The transistor's maximum junction temperature is 200°C and their thermal resistance, junction to case, is 2-0°C/W. The circuit operates from a 75 volt supply rail and delivers its output power to a 10 Ω load. The heat sink has a thermal resistance of 3-5°C/W and the amplifier is intended to operate in ambient temperatures up to 50°C. a Determine the maximum power output which the amplifier can deliver to the 10 Ω load under maximum ambient temperature conditions"
