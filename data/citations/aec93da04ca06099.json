      "Directors: Alan Ereira and David Wallace",
      "4-tape set. Monty Python’s complete history of the Crusades with medievalist Terry Jones as host. Funny and educational at the same time. The story of Robin Hood has become a film industry. The castles are fanciful and spectacular, but have little resemblance to castles of the twelfth century—the period of Richard the Lion Hearted and Robin Hood. Watch for all the mistakes in castle design made by the producers. Some of the best—and funniest—productions are: Robin Hood",
