The pseudo-Pythagorean authors are worth considering in this chapter because they show just how different the new world and its theories could become; they may well form part of a Roman imperial “common culture.” Bibliographic Essay 321 On the traditional schools, Shipley, Greek World, 176–82, provides a concise overview. On the Minos, see Leo Strauss’s highly unconventional treatment in “On the Minos",
      "307–9. On Theophrastus and his relationship to Athens and Athenian political thought, see Ober, PDDA, 364–6"
