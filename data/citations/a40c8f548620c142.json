Dr. Kim worked as an Electrical Engineer for the University of Hawaii at the Naval Ocean Systems Center, Hawaii Labs at Kaneohe Marine Corps Air Station after graduating with his B.S.E.E. Upon completing his M.S.E.E., he was an electrical engineer with the National Bureau of Standards in Boulder, Colorado designing hardware for precision fiber optic measurements. He then entered the commercial sector as a staff engineer with Burroughs Corporation in San Diego, California developing fiber optic LAN systems. He left Burroughs for Tacan/IPITEK Corporation as Manager of Electro-Optic Systems developing fiber optic CATV hardware and systems"
