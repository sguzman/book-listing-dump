      "were available in a metropolitan department of sociology, a medical school de­ partment of public health and in Yale’s Department of Applied Physiology. For pure excitement, stimulation and opportunity, there seemed to be no choice but to remain at Yale. Howard W. Haggard, famed physiologist and medical historian, had assembled in his Laboratory of Applied Physiology one of the few truly interdisciplinary groups in the academic world. Physiology, pharmacology, biochemistry, medicine, psychiatry, psychology, anthropology, law, economics, biometrics, education and theology were all represented and a sociology group headed by Seldon Bacon, one of my most stim­ ulating teachers",
      "Barber describes the Society and Henderson’s role in its establish­ ment: the Society, which Henderson started thinking about as early as 1924, was finally established in 1933 with an endowment from President Lowell, to provide a presti­ gious place and adequate resources in the university for young men of exceptional talent and independence in any field of science and scholarship. In the small group responsible for founding the Society—Henderson, Lowell, the philosopher A. N. Whitehead, the English literature scholar John Livingston Lowes, and the lawyer and author Charles P. Curtis—Henderson took the lead; his conception of the Society was scientifically cosmopolitan, if somewhat elitist, and he was the organizer of the found­ ing committee, the author of its founding report, and finally, the first chairman of the senior fellows of the Society, who were responsible for the selection and minor guid­ ance of the junior fellows",
      ". hoped that the Society would encourage not only “isolated geniuses, but men who will do the work of the world"
