After an Athenian victory over Thebes in 457 B.C., the government of the city was changed from an OLIGARCHY, or rule by a few, to a See map in Sparta",
      "The oligarchy was restored when Thebes won a victory over Athens in 447 B.C. During the PELOPONNESIAN WAR, Thebes sided with SPARTA against Athens. Later, however, it fought against Sparta and eventually drove the Spartans from central Greece. King PHILIP II of MACEDONIA captured Thebes in 338 B.C. When Thebes revolted against Philip's son ALEXANDER THE GREAT a few years later, the Macedonians destroyed the city. Although it was rebuilt, Thebes never regained its former greatness"
