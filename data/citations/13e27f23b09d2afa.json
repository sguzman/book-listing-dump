      "swine in several herds in Buena Park, California, came down with a vesicular disease that was soon diagnosed as FMD. The epizootic led to the quarantining of sections of Los Angeles, Orange, and San Bernardino countries. State and Federal forces conquered the outbreak in sixteen days, after the slaughter and burial of 118,817 hogs, 46 cattle, and 24 goats",
      "The 1932 Outbreak of Foot-and-Mouth Disease in Southern California",
      "At the time, observers noted that the contagion did not spread through the livestock populations with the speed typical of FMD, but they attributed this to the efficiency of the control efforts. A similar disease appeared among San Diego swine in 1933. In this case, investigators determined that the causal agent was a new disease, vesicular exanthema of swine. This had symptoms that mimicked FMD and vesicular stomatitis. The vesicular exanthema discovery led to a consensus that 1929 was the last outbreak of FMD in the United States",
