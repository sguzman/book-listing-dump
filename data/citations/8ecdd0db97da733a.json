      "Historically, significant educational differences had long existed between the North, South, and West of the country, as schooling conformed to the social and economic factors that distinguished them. The industrial and highly urbanized Northeast and upper Midwest, for instance, had traditionally invested more heavily in public education than the agricultural South, while the West exhibited the nation’s highest levels of attainment. The development of national markets, however, along with improved transportation and communication networks, contributed to a gradual convergence in these regional characteristics",
