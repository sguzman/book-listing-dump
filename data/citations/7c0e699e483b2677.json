      "Amanda Lohiser, in a 2017 College Teaching essay, recounts a similarly transformative bout of laryngitis. Unable to speak for a number of weeks, Lohiser prepared Power­Point pre­sen­ta­tions of her lectures, and then during the class she passed a microphone around the hall, with each student presenting a slide. Students ­were encouraged to not just read the slide’s text but pre­sent the material, along with their own interpretations of the significance of the ideas.

      "Donald Finkel details a more formalized version of this present-­but-­ silent professor in his book Teaching with Your Mouth Shut. In his “open seminar,” students arrive to class with questions about a reading, then discuss the text in a circle, led by their own questions, while the teacher sits outside the circle and observes",
