      "The definition of “supermarkets” has changed over time. In the early 1930s, the Supermarket Institute, one of the largest trade organ­izations for food retailers, originally defined a “supermarket” as a food outlet with minimum annual sales of $250,000, and with a grocery department operated on a self-­ service basis. In 1951, this definition was revised and the minimum annual sales volume was raised to $500,000 annually. In 1955, the minimum volume was raised to $1 million. ­Today, the Food Marketing Institute (the successor of the Supermarket Institute) defines the term as a store offering a full line of groceries, meat, and produce with at least $2 million in annual sales"
