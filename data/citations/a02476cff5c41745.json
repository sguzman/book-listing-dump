Whereas among those with the lowest level of education unemployment dropped only to 65% of its 1992 level, in the USA and UK the decrease was very small: to 81.6% of its 1992 figure. That lack of education is a corrosive disadvantage in determining one’s chances to be employed is the implication of yet another study, this time referring to data from all OECD countries. It analyses the participation of men aged 25–64 in the labour force according to level of education. In the thirty-one countries studied, employment rates for men in the labour force aged 25–64 were examined, dividing the sample into three groups: those with less than upper secondary education; those with upper secondary Notes 215 education; and those with tertiary education"
