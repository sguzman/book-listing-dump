      "With two exceptions, previous scholars of the topic have described the siege without analyzing it in the context of the existing laws of war. Aside from John Walters (who labeled Sherman a “merchant of terror”) and Stephen Davis, historians do not pass negative judgment against Sherman for his decision to turn his guns on the city. Richard McMurry, who has written the most cogent and clearest assessment of the campaign, concludes: “although the bombardment damaged some buildings and on occasion killed or injured soldiers and civilians, it soon became obvious that the artillery could neither cut off rail traffic into and out of Atlanta nor force Hood and the Rebels to evacuate the city",
