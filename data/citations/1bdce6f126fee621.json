      "As a relatively weak power in the world immediately after the American Revolution, the United States benefited from a law of nations that presumed the equality of sovereign polities based on natural law principles. Moreover, the Republic found that natural law principles fostered Americans’ overseas commerce by supporting U.S. neutrality during the European conflicts of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. By the mid-Â�1810s, the situation had changed. Dangers to international trade subsided when the Napoleonic Wars ended, and key U.S. military successes bolstered American confidence in the strength of the nation. On the eve of the Seminole War, the United States had less of a stake in a natural-Â�law-Â�based law of nations.
