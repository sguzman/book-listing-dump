Nonetheless, a 20 percent urbanization of Europe by c. 1300, which represents a doubling from older estimates of around 10 percent, is probably the upper limit of what could be sustained by agricultural production and commodity markets in the rural hinterlands.

      "In 1986, he argued that the Christ Church experience underestimated general mortality, on the basis of a comparison with data from the seventeenth–eighteenth century Benedictine monastery of Saint-Maur, which had both better life expectancies that those of contemporary Frenchmen and “enormously better expectations of life” than the fifteenth-century Benedictines of Christ Church. In 2006, however, he changed his mind, arguing that the Christ Church monks, owing to their communal lifestyle, suffered an “enhanced exposure to infectious disease” and that “the vast majority of people living outside the cloister enjoyed somewhat more favourable conditions”. This was based on a new comparison with studies of Dutch monks from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. 160 Nightingale, “New Evidence"

Poos found that turnover rates in several Essex communities during the first half of the fourteenth century, prior to the plague, were comparable to those recorded 300 years later, in the seventeenth century. Evidence also indicates that when people migrated, they did not travel very far, typically within 10 miles of their native villages",
