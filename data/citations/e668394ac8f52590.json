Surprisingly, according to the Los Angeles Times exit polls, almost half the 1984 voters who felt that the federal deficit was the most important election issue supported Reagan rather than Mondale. Apparently many voters bought the Republican charge that the tax increase Mondale advocated to help reduce the enormous federal deficits opened up under Reagan would, in the end, wind up being used to finance new federal spending."

An alternative but empirically and theoretically identical interpretation of the UT equation is that the parties have different ideas about the normal, or natural, rate of unemployment, UN, which lead them to pursue different targets. 14. A fascinating account of this process during the early days of the Reagan administration, which hit the ground running harder than most, appears in William Greider's now famous article liThe Education of David Stockman"
