      "The Apocryphal New Testament, 303–310. The numbering in Elliott begins at 18 because the first 17 paragraphs are not considered original. Paragraph 18 brings John from Miletus to Ephesus for a lengthy stay (19–36). After a long gap, the story picks up in 87–105 with a discourse on the nature of Christ and a hymn of Christ. Then, paragraphs 37– 55 report the end of John’s stay in Ephesus, paragraphs 58– 61 return him to Ephesus, and the text then concludes with a reconstruction of 62– 86 and 106–115 reporting John’s second stay in Ephesus.
