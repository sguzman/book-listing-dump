Hofman came closest to directly engaging Ball’s analysis when he showed that native and foreign whites in Boston, Massachusetts, Providence, Rhode Island, and Washington, D.C., lived on average ten years longer than Boston’s blacks. The data were limited, uneven, and awkwardly presented, since he had no “Colored” data for Providence and Washington, and no “Foreign” data for Boston. He also admitted that “the Irish population shows some similarity in its mortality to the negro population"
