      "is an exemplary study of ratification within a critical state in which Anti-Federalists predominated. The adoption of the first ten amendments to the Constitution – better known as the Bill of Rights – is often seen as the culmination as well as the sequel to the constitutional debates of 1787–88. Many studies of the subject focus on the historical origins and legal content of the particular rights that finally made their way into the constitutional text. Perhaps the leading scholar in this field has been Leonard Levy, and many of his findings are distilled in his book, Original Intent and the Framers’ Constitution",
