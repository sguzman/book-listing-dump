Any member of the Sejm could nullify all legislation passed in the current session by yelling Nie pozwalam! (literally: “I do not allow!”). Conceived as a way to limit royal power, it rendered the Sejm hostage to conservative opponents of change, whom foreign powers often bribed to cast vetoes.

Perhaps the most convincing is the advantages derived from decades of direct rule during the colonial period, during which a groundwork for democratic politics was laid and indigenous elites with strong commitments to democracy developed. But other factors, such as unusual luck in its early leaders, must also have played a role in view of the fact that Pakistan did not harvest similar benefits from the indirect-rule legacy"

The United States pushed for elections in Lebanon in 2005 and in Gaza and the West Bank in 2006 as part of the campaign to show that regime change in Iraq was having its hoped-for domino effect. But the results strengthened Hezbollah and Hamas, an unwelcome outcome for Israel and many of its supporters in the United States. Elsewhere I have argued that refusing to recognize the Hamas victory was a tactical blunder, particularly when coupled with their proposal for a government of national unity with the PLO and a ten-year truce with Israel. It offered the best basis for a negotiated settlement since Yitzhak Rabin’s assassination a decade earlier"
