      "Much literature on German economic history, and an overwhelming majority of general studies, concentrate on Prussia. In the context of discussing agrarian development in the eighteenth century, Clapham writes: “As Prussia after 1815 was the sole state representative of almost all Germany, with lands stretching from the servile Slavonic east to the free Dutch west, the Prussian development deserves the closest study. It illustrates every point of importance",
      "Tribe, in turn, points out that “the history of the German economy in the eighteenth century is dominated by Prussia—whose territories and institutions extended across northern and eastern Germany",
