He covers how the term is employed in cultural anthropology, and then turns to its archaeological uses. In archaeology, “process” was used before the 1960s primarily to discuss diachronic cultural evolution. Beginning in the 1960s, processes became embedded in systems theory models, and later in ideas about the formation processes of the archaeological record. The article concludes with examinations of various processual 320 Suggested Readings models, highlighting their complexity. He ends with suggestions for the further use of process concepts"

Using lipid analysis (the study of residual fats in pottery), the authors have demonstrated that specific pottery types were used for particular foods, and that there was differential use of meat and dairy products between Stonehenge and the Durrington residential complex. The conclusion is that feasting united a diverse population in activities in the greater Durrington Walls-Stonehenge landscape"
