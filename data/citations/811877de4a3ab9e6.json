      "It is not so much that there has been a conscious movement to smuggle the sacred back into the campus history classroom, although a few brave souls have openly called for academics to recognize appeals to supernatural forces as valid warrants for truth claims in histories written by Native Americans, for example. Well intentioned as such proposals may be, it is not in the strategic interest of religious minorities to open up the discourse of professional historians to the supernatural—in a nation as overwhelmingly Christian and devout as the United States, the outcome would not be the sort of warm, fuzzy, “many paths to God” spiritual affirmation that sometimes passes as religious investment in college towns"
