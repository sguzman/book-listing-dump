      "Two other approaches, which also use the paradigm of creative destruction, deserve mention. The first, developed by Ernest Liu, Atif Mian, and Amir Sufi, highlights the idea that the continuous fall in interest rates over the past two de­cades increases the discounted value of being a leader. For a “leader” firm, this higher discounted value increases the pre­sent benefit of its technological leadership over other firms. It follows that the fall in interest rates w ­ ill induce “leader” firms in each sector to innovate more in order to increase their leadership, which w ­ ill discourage innovation by “nonleader” firms in that sector. As a result, concentration increases while innovation and aggregate growth potentially decrease",
