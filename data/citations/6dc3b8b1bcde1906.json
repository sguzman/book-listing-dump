      "Some people might argue the case for Homer. But Virgil has had far greater influence on the literature of all periods after the end of antiquity. 3 The sources are vague on this point. The fullest Life is that by Donatus. He says, with marked lack of clarity, that Pollio, Varus and Gallus were responsible for saving the poet’s land (19), as does the Vita Probiana; Servius attributes the restitution to Pollio and Maecenas (20). 4 For a convenient introduction to Virgil’s philosophical interests, see S.M.Braund, ‘Virgil and the cosmos: Religious and philosophical ideas’"
