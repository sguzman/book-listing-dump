If, as Bloom contends, religious ecstasy is collective in European protestantism, then in American ‘protestantism’ it is solitary."

If romanticism is the American religion (or if American religion is romantic), then this is perhaps because of its dependence upon protestantism and the specific affirmation of the ordinary or the everyday that can be found within protestant religion. In this connection, see ‘The affirmation of ordinary life’, in Charles Taylor’s The Sources of the Self"
