The Lockheed scandal in Japan resulted in the prosecution of various officials including Kakuei Tanaka (Prime Minister in office from 1972–1974). In the Netherlands, Prince Bernhardt resigned when inquiries into allegations that he had received $1 million from Lockheed were initiated.

This principle, which has been adopted by a number of common law jurisdictions, has been variously applied, ranging from the narrow to the wide. The English courts have adopted a narrow application, meaning that the act of person lower down the command structure of a company will not be viewed as the act of a directing mind. To illustrate in Tesco Supermarkets v Natrass [1972] AC 153, it was held that a manager could not be a directing mind. A wider application would find the directing mind further down the command chain"
