      "Virginia and Kentucky together had one-​third of the entire southern mulatto population. Virginia had 80,000 mulattos of the total 350,000 southwide. In fact, Williamson argues that the upper south and in particular Virginia could have earned the designation “the mulatto belt” in contrast to the Deep South’s “black belt",
      "50 percent of the mulatto population was free. This is in deep contrast to the lower South and also the Upper south states to the west. In the upper South, the census suggests that “mulattoes” lived in rural areas more than urban areas",
