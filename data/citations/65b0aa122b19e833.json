      "Ford lagged behind General Motors not only in automobile styling and product differentiation, but also in financing. With its Ford Weekly Purchase Plan, introduced in 1923, potential purchasers were offered the chance to save $5 per week in a special interest-bearing account, obtaining the car when the purchase price had been saved up (the 1923 purchase price of a Motel T Ford was as low as $265; see chapter 5). The plan was a failure, eliciting little consumer interest when they had the alternative of obtaining the car in advance of the repayment under the installment plan favored by GMAC. Ford did not create a unit to compete with GMAC until 1928"
