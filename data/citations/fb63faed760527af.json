      "Interestingly, upon returning to command the NYPD under Mayor de Blasio, Bratton expressed concern about the drift occasioned by CompStat from measurement of enforcement activity to an end in itself. In a 2015 speech, he said: “[W]hen I left L.A. and moved back to New York as a private citizen, I noticed something: the crime-prevention outcome—the results—was being confused with the enforcement inputs—the means. When we designed CompStat, ‘more’ was never the point. ‘Safer’ was the point. And in New York, we’ve returned the system to its roots. We care about results, not numbers. It’s what the numbers represent that matters",
