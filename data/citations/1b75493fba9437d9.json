      "Cassirer, The Myth of the State, 77. 91. In ongoing scholarship on The Myth of the State, ­t here is an emergent hypothesis that Cassirer’s views on myth have been mischaracterized by Charles Hendel, Frederick W. Lenz, and Brand Blanshar, the editors of the posthumous publication. Whereas Cassirer’s condemnation of myth appears unambiguous in the published edition, part 3 of the Nachlass version, published in 2008, offers a mixed assessment that is reconciled to the prospect that myth is a permanent feature of culture, and arguably leaves open the possibility that modern po­liti­cal myths might be countered with other, novel myths",
