Of these C.S.2186 has a very limited the probable shape *EC in view of the distribution of C.S.2187x, distribution, and is probably a late development in the north-west although the unequivocal entries in the second section attest *ECJ, i.e. during the Bantu period. The other two C.S. are both widespread but a combination of the two causative extensions that may have occurred differ in two respects. The first of these C.S. consists of two sections in PB-B. It does not seem feasible to assess the probable origin of the with different distributions, one consisting of extensions and the other multivalent entries, since there are also a few unequivocal entries in of extension elements in an alternation *am/(*ik) neuter j (active). On C.S.2191a that attest *EKJ. The presence of *j in the entries in the other hand C.S.2190 contains a second section with the meaning C.S.2187y is not easy to explain, although in the items quoted in the potential, although there are sufficient entries with both meanings to second section, which correspond to *jcj, the closeness of the first vowel justify presenting both sections as a single C.S. Since it would seem could be due to assimilation. This is not so with the entry from Dyala unlikely that there were two PB-X extensions with the meaning neuter, A.24 which probably corresponds to *}ci. It may therefore be tentathe simplest way to account for these two C.S. is to regard *EK as the tively concluded then that the shape of the causative extension in PB-X PB-X extension meaning neuter, since its reflexes cover most of the was *EC"
