Up until the Eocene, a westward-flowing ocean current spanned the circumference of the entire globe. Afterwards the gaps that separated Asia from Africa, and North America from South America gradually closed up, stopping the trans-global ocean gateway. Simulations with a simplified computer model suggest that a circum-global ocean circulation warming the high latitudes by pumping more heat up from the tropics makes a big difference to climate; closing it off shuts the heat pump down",

      "The biochemical details are that C4 plants contain a special enzyme, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEP-C), that converts inorganic carbon dioxide into a four-carbon organic acid called oxaloacetic acid (OAA). PEP-C is the attachment enzyme and the only enzyme common to all C4 plants. Most C4 plants then convert OAA into malate before pumping it into the bundle sheath cells where it is catalytically converted to sugar by Rubisco after carbon dioxide is enzymically stripped off. C4 plants have evolved families of ‘detachment’ enzymes for this purpose going by the acronyms NAD-ME",

      "Aerosols are abundant in the air we breathe and range in size from sub-microscopic to the almost visible. Sulfur compounds, in the form of droplets of sulfuric acid and ammonium sulfate, are the most important from a climatic point of view. In the pre-industrial era when the air was cleaner, most of the sulfate came from the oceans. Today the main source is from sulfur dioxide produced by industrial processes, and it outstrips the natural sources of sulfur by a factor of three to one",
