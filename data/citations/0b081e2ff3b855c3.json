      "*s another case in point. Although a jury found the defendant not guilty of beating his own slave, it wanted the court to express its \"strong disapprobation of similar conduct.\" Many major uprisings (or reports of uprisings) coincided with national elections, military actions, or economic recessions. Vesey, an ex-slave, allegedly planned the most extensive slave revolt in U.S. history in Charleston in 1822. Turner's uprising took place in Southampton County, Virginia, on August 21, 1831. An earlier rebellion took place on September 9, 1739, near the west branch of the Stono River in South Carolina. Even New York suffered from insurrections in 1712 and 1749. Slave Gabriel Prosser supposedly wanted to overtake Richmond in 1800. A large revolt occurred in 1811 just outside New Orleans; another took place in Texas in 1835 during the state's revolution. Waves of rebellions swept over the nation in 1856 and i860. See Harper, Slavery Without Cotton, 91; Mohr, Slavery in Oglethorpe County, 104; Ran kin",

      "Other states were more successful. Mississippi passed a statute in 1817 to prevent slaves from raising cotton for their own benefit. Georgia's law of 1816 fined masters $15 if their slaves sold cotton, tobacco, or grain; the law of 1830 forbade slaves in the city of Twiggs from selling poultry. Statutes appear in Finkelman, State Slavery Statutes. Some scholars have reported that, despite such laws, slaves continued to produce foodstuffs, raise stock and poultry, and engage in such activities as wood-cutting and moss-gathering",
