It pertains to black performers appearing before a white audience as he saw in Rochester with Gavitt’s Original Ethiopian Serenaders in 1849. A year earlier, Douglass disapprovingly described white performers in blackface as “the filthy scum of white society, who have stolen from us a complexion denied to them by nature, in which to make money, and pander to the corrupt taste of their white fellow citizens"

      "Scholars seem torn on the question of Southern hatred of Stowe. Thomas Gossett claims that in journals, at least, animosity toward Stowe lessened significantly within two years after the publication of Uncle Tom’s Cabin, though Gossett admits that the debate may have continued in Southern newspapers. Joseph Roppolo emphasizes the longevity of Southern white hatred of Stowe, especially in New Orleans. See Joseph Roppolo, “Harriet Beecher Stowe and New Orleans: A Study in Hate"
