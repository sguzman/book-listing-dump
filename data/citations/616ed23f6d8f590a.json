      "Whereas Japanese feudalism, more or less comparable to European feudalism, was postulated by early Japanese scholars and recognized by their western peers (for example, Hintze, Bloch, Ganshof, and Coulborn), more recent scholarship on Japan has become increasingly sceptical about the European and even feudal analogy, at the same time as European feudalism itself has come under increasing criticism. What has actually been shown, however, independently in both cases, is that in both of them the growth and formalization of feudalism were more complex and uneven than earlier held. For Europe see endnote 6. For the military aspect in Japan (in addition to the preceding note): William Farris, Heavenly Warriors: The evolution of Japan’s military, 500–1300",
      "Karl Friday, Hired Swords: The rise of private warrior power in early Japan",
      "The rhetoric surrounding these generally sound observations has created the misleading impression that the new studies claim that the concept of feudalism itself was unsubstantiated.
