      "About the Cover The cover of the fifth edition of Rizzoni’s Principles and Applications of Electrical Engineering features the Ohio State University Buckeye Bullet. Students from a variety of engineering disciplines, working with Professor Rizzoni through the university’s Center for Automotive Research, designed and built this electric powered streamliner for the purpose of establishing new land speed records for electric vehicles. In October 2004, the Buckeye Bullet set a new U.S. land speed record at 314.958 mph and a new International land speed record at 271.737 mph, becoming the fastest self-powered electric vehicle in history. The Buckeye Bullet is 30 feet long, and is powered by a variable-speed AC induction drive supplied by a 1,000-V NiMH battery pack"
