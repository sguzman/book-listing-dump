James Galbraith, John McCole, and James Oakes and Deborah Bohr extended gracious hospitality to me during certain very important research field trips, which would have been neither possible nor successful without their generosity. Financial support for the project was provided by the American Council of Learned Societies, the Herbert Hoover Presidential Library Association, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the National Humanities Center, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, and, at the University of California, San Diego, the Division of Arts and Humanities and the Academic Senate Committee on Research. Various portions of the manuscript were presented before several professional audiences whose criticisms, suggestions, and encouragement played no small part in the book’s realization. The venues included the economics departments at UCLA, UC-Riverside, the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, the New School for Social Research, Western Michigan University, and Yale University; the history departments at the University of Chicago, the Ohio State University, and the Washington University of St"
