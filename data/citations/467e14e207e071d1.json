      "One part of this shift, but only one, is the mandatory research and teaching assessment, which measures faculty research and teaching effectiveness in mechanical ways (number of pages, whether the instructor uses PowerPoint, and so forth). The more insidious aspect is the demand—once implicit, now quite open—that research be shown to have “impact,” meaning contribution to national economic goals. 6. Scotland used to have a four-year B.A. degree, with the first year devoted to liberal arts courses. The commitment of Scottish universities to the liberal arts was famous even in the nineteenth century: John Stuart Mill’s Inaugural Lecture at the University of St. Andrews praises the suitability of the Scottish university system for democratic citizenship, by contrast with England’s narrower curriculum, focused on theology. The standardization of higher education imposed by the EU’s Bologna scheme, however, has made Scotland assimilate to the rest of Europe, rather than vice versa. 7"
