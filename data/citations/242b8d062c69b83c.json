Even though Clark himself had reservations about the accuracy of the study, it was still cited by Warren in his Brown opinion. For Clark’s impact on Brown v. Board of Education, as well as critiques of his methodology (for example, that poverty or discrimination more generally, rather than school segregation, was responsible for the self-denigration of black children), see Sitkoff, A New Deal for Blacks",

In 1967 they were the target of a federal anti-poverty program that dissolved in criminality and gang warfare; in 1969, renamed the Black P (for “prince” or “power”) Stone Nation, they once more attempted to achieve respectability with federal assistance but again failed, charged with fraud"

      "The rise of mass consumption of sugar in Britain and continental Europe supported large-scale Caribbean plantations that far outlasted the British abolition of slavery in 1838. Slave populations in the colonies that became the United States were self-reproducing, importing only about 6 percent of the slaves brought to the New World, but those of the Caribbean depended on continual replenishment. At the time of emancipation, the slave population of the United States was more than six times the number imported, whereas that of Jamaica, with a life expectancy for slaves of only seven to ten years, was less than half the number it had imported. As a more specific example, between 1700 and 1774 some 500,000 slaves were brought to Jamaica, but the slave population grew by only 150,000",

In the view of Benzion Netanyahu, moreover, the Inquisition did not persecute Marranos because they were still secretly practicing Judaism; rather, it persecuted them as Christians who were deemed racially still to be Jews. That is, the fiction of rooting out Judaizers authorized an anti-Semitic campaign designed not to eradicate heresy among Marranos but to eradicate Marranos among the Spanish people"

      "Faced with the radical destabilization of his regime, King Hussein of Jordan struck back in September 1970 at both the PFLP and Fatah, by this point effectively indistinguishable from the PLO. Fatah then moved its base of operations to Lebanon by the summer of 1971, which in turn led to a large increase in terror operations against northern Israel in the next four years and the advent of Black September, which engaged in a two-year campaign of terrorism, including letter bombs addressed to prominent Israelis and Jews around the world, and culminating in the heinous attack that killed eleven Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics. Financed by Libya, Syria, and Algeria, Black September, which took its name from the month of Hussein’s crackdown, was also loosely allied with groups such as the German Baader-Meinhof Gang and the Japanese Red Army",
      "Although Black September as such ceased its major operations by 1973, Palestinian hijackings continued into the early 1980s, by which point twenty-nine airlines had been targeted and a number of planes brought down by bombs"

      "In the postwar era, Egypt became a center for Islamic anti-Jewish research and publication. The Protocols of the Elders of Zion was publicly recommended by both Nasser, himself a Holocaust denier, and Anwar Sadat, while the blood libel appeared in a variety of published forms, including an official 1962 United Arab Republic (Egypt and Syria) publication, Talmudic Human Sacrifices. A popular government pamphlet titled Israel, the Enemy of Africa, released in 1965, featured citations from the Protocols and Henry Ford’s screed The International Jew. Especially in the wake of the 1967 and 1973 wars, there was an outpouring of depictions of Jews in government publications and textbooks as satanic contrivers of plots (including the assassinations of presidents Lincoln and Kennedy) and enemies of Muhammad determined to liquidate Arab culture in Palestine and advance Zionism’s domination throughout the Arab world. By the 1980s and 1990s, such propaganda had evolved to include accusations that Jews, representatives of an inferior and despicable culture, were responsible for spreading cancer, AIDS, syphilis, drug addiction, genetically poisoned crops and poultry, pornography, prostitution, and abortion",

Facing pressure from the Kennedy administration, Israel agreed to regular American inspections but continued to deny that it was involved in nuclear weapons production, an explanation the United States publicly accepted. At the same time, Moshe Dayan spoke of the “bomb in the basement,” a way of saying that a weapon was being developed without being tested and thus without being openly acknowledged. When Egypt carried out uninterdicted reconnaissance over Dimona in May 1967 and radio signals implied an attack was imminent, it underscored the need for Israel to strike preemptively",
