That bill lets employees subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act overtime provision choose whether to bank the overtime hours they work to use later as compensation or take their overtime pay. Employers, however, could choose to give extra hours only to those picking the comptime option. Further, people who agree to work comp time cannot necessarily take their owed time when they want it. They can use it only when it’s convenient for the employer—which may or may not work for the employee",
