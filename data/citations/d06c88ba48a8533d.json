      "Nixon also transferred many programs administered by the OEO to other federal departments. In one of his most controversial appointments, Nixon positioned Howard Phillips to succeed Donald Rumsfeld as director of the OEO and ordered Phillips to withhold community action funds in anticipation of the agency’s dissolution. However, a federal district court forced the unconfirmed Phillips to resign and ruled that the president could not withhold funds that had been allocated by Congress. Even though the court ruling kept the agency alive, Ford officially closed the office in 1975 and replaced it with the Civil Ser vices Administration.

The legislation created a National Institute of Corrections, which brought together an advisory board from the spectrum of federal law enforcement and criminal justice agencies and private-sector groups to set priorities within carceral institutions and award contracts to firms to implement those priorities. Designed to operate as a small consultant group appointed by the attorney general and removed from public accountability in the Bureau of Prisons, the institute served as an information clearinghouse and trained law enforcement and social ser vice personnel. In order to equip penal authorities with stronger tools to manage unprecedented numbers of inmates, the institute supported research on a range of pressing issues, including correctional security, classification systems, and gang control programs"
