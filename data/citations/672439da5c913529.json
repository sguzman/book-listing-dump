Union membership was relatively low before World War I, and the available data are not wholly reliable, in part because of the complexities of aggregating evidence from agricultural and industrial unions of different political complexions. 148. From his detailed study of working-class organization in Sesto San Giovanni, Bell reaches a similar conclusion: \"Pre-factory cultural traditions significantly conditioned the formation of a modern Italian working class and its political action\" (\"Worker Culture and Worker Politics",

      "Union membership at the regional level in 1921 is correlated r — .58 with the fraction of the workforce in industry, and r = -.49 with the fraction of the workforce in agriculture, but these correlations are spurious, attributable to the joint dependence of both union membership and economic development on civic traditions. 149.
