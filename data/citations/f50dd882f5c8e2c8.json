Du Bois employed only one concrete example of this self-­segregation in his series of editorials, reaching back to the 1929–1930 “­Don’t Buy Where You ­Can’t Work” campaign in Chicago that helped initiate a de­cade of mass protest in and around Washington Park on the South Side; he briefly endorsed the campaign in the March 1930 Crisis.
