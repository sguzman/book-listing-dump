      "In this essay I suggest that Hoccleve and Caxton represent two intertwined, yet distinct English literary cultures, Lancastrian and Yorkist. Recent scholarship has become increasingly interested in Lancastrian literary culture, and Hoccleve's Regement has served as a main point of exploration. Critical assessments of the Regement tend to be polarized. For these two views see David Lawton's \"Dullness and the Fifteenth Century",
      "761-99, and Paul Strohm's Usurpation and the Language of Legitimation, 1399-1422",
      "the argument of which is reviewed in Strohm's chapter \"Hoccleve, Lydgate and the Lancastrian Court;' in The Cambridge History of Medieval English Literature",
      "Growing interest in Hoccleve's Regement is further reflected by the new TEAMS edition, Thomas Hoccleve:The Regiment of Princes",
      "which contains a very useful introduction and bibliography. Caxton studies have been slower to develop, and as a result, Yorkist literary culture is often blurred into a generalized fifteenth-century worldview",
