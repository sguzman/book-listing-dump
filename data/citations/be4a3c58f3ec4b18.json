A full 20%, or about 160,000 of all those ordered to report decided to evade illegally, rather than try to raise the $300 commutation fee or find a substitute—legal ways to avoid being drafted. One of the areas with the highest rates of draft evasion was in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, partly due to physical proximity to the Canadian border. Muir was thus hardly alone in his decision to strike out for Canada in fear of the draft",

A Tramp Trip served as his report on Europe, replete with observations about working classes and conditions. He was then assigned to research and report on similar subjects in the United States. The resulting book, The Tramp at Home, offered less encouragement to travel in tramp style for pleasure, and belonged more to the genre of social investigations of tramps and the working class, although he expressed relative sympathy with their plight and lamented the growing divergence in wealth"

      "Felicity Scott reflects intriguingly on these connections, drawing upon Hannah Arendt’s analysis of the “internment camp” as “the only ‘country’ the world had to offer the stateless.” In my view, the mechanism can also work the other direction: where occupants become effectively “stateless” by residing in such functional or enforced camps. Further, the upbeat version of the biological need argument has its troubling counterpart. Giorgio Agamben, building on Arendt’s observation of camps as throwing “people back into a peculiar state of nature,” explained camps as embodying a “state of exception” where political “power” can confront “pure biological life without any mediation"
